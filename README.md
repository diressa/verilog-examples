A collection of Verilog testbench simulations and synthesis programs.

Icarus Verilog and GTKwave on a MacOS were used for production.

Prereqs: Iverilog installed on terminal, and the GTKwave application.

1. Open terminal, being in the same filepath where the files are downloaded.
2. Then type... "iverilog -o [filename] [filename].v [filename_tb].v"
3. "vvp [filename]"
4. A new file [filename].vcd should be created. This can be opened in GTKwave.
